# bmp_reader

Welcome to the bmp_reader repository.
This very small program allows you to display bmp images straight to your terminal, by ascii.

Just type `make` to compile the sources.

Launch the output executable with a BMP source file to make it display the picture.

For now, it doesnt work for all types of images : just the simplest type of BMP is compatible.
